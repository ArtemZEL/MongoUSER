## Install all package
After cloning the project, install all the packages by writing the command
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```
## Connecting your Database
For this mini application, I use the MongoDB Compass database, and to connect to it, you need to create a ```.env``` file to connect to your database and specify the following
```
MongoDBUrl="mongodb://localhost:PORT/nameDB"
``` 

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
